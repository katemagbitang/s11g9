I will admit that I may not know much about the situation other than ABS-CBN refusing to air Duterte's ads during the 2016 elections. But if it's because of just that, I think that's way too much.

[ quotes bible verse ].” or even “They say they want equality but they are demanding privileges.”\r\n\r\nBut why? I mean, even if you think being LGBT is a sin, didn’t Jesus say to love the sinner and hate the sin? Discrimination against gender is bad and I say this as a guy. Also, even if you don’t care about that, isn’t SOGIE more than the LGBT? It’s also about equal rights between men and women? From my understanding, once the bill becomes law, it is now prohibited for workplaces to reject you simply because you’re part of the LGBT community.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to a question, why are so many against this bill?\r\n","postDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1586085347727"}},"comments":[],"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}
